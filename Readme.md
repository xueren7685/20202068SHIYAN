My game name is Greedy Snake Game.The object of the game is to eat as much
food as possible by controlling a snake's movements and trying to avoid collisions
with itself or walls.The game is mainly divided into snakes, food, and game scenes. Realize snake
movement, food generation, collision detection and so on.
The main gameplay of the game is that the player uses the keyboard to control the snake to eat food, and the snake will gradually grow longer after eating food. Points are constantly scored during the game, and if the snake's head touches the snake's body or touches the screen border, game over is displayed.





1.Snake movement
Smooth snake movement and player control input. Process the player's keyboard
input and update the snake's position. Control the movement speed of the snake and
avoid unexpected situations during the movement of the snake. First set the base
position of the snake, and then set the initial length of the snake. Use the keyboard
to control the snake's movements. The snake's body grows with each fruit it eats.




2.Food productionThe 
food is generated at random coordinates and disappears when the snake
touches it. There will also be a score on the screen, adding one point for each food
eaten.



3.Collision detection
I wanted to determine by the position of the snake head and other game elements, whether it touched the food, whether it touched the border, whether it touched
itself. game over is automatically displayed when touching a boundary or snake itself.


4.beautify
I wanted to add sound effects and graphics to beautify the interface and make the
game more complete.
